# Backend-Redirect
This plugin allows you to redirect a player to another seperate server depending on backend server. This allows you to redirect players to a partner network as an example (Meaning that you can link multiple Velocity networks together). You can also just send your players to your best friend's serverüòÅ.

The config is in
`plugins/backendredirect/config.yml`
